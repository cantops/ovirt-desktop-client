Upgrading from v. 1.0.x to v. 2.0.x
===================================

Version v. 1.0.x differs in v 2.0.x in the package version of
the ovirt-engine-sdk-python package. The first version worked
with version 3.6 of the SDK package, while version 2.0x works
with version 4.1.x of the SDK package. This package introduces
significant differences so the code had to be substantially
rewritten. In order to upgrade from ovirt-desktop-client v.
1.0.x to 2.0.x please run:

   pip install -r requirements

This will upgrade the ovirt-engine-sdk-python package which is
needed to work with version 2.0.x of ovirt-desktop-client.

Also, please define the mandatory parameter ovirt:cafile. From
oVirt version 4.0 it is mandatory to specify the CA cert of
the oVirt instance you want to connect to.
